# m8070PresetDecoder
This python file was compiled under python3.8 using imported lxml 4.62
It is used to decode the xml file of the Instrument settings (InstrumentState.xml) and show them in human readable format. From there you can copy and paste into excel and convert text to table  or do what you like.
It also shows what modules were present when the preset was created.
